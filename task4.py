# 1. Create two DataFrames:
#    a. One with customer information (CustomerID, Name).
#    b. Another with order details (OrderID, CustomerID, Amount).
# 2. Merge the two DataFrames on CustomerID to create a single DataFrame showing customer names and their respective order amounts.

# Bonus Challenge:
# 1. Use Pandas to clean a messy dataset by:
#    a. Removing rows with missing values.
#    b. Replacing invalid data with default values.
#    c. Sorting the data by a specific column.
# 2. Save the cleaned dataset to a new file.
